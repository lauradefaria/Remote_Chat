# Remote_Chat
It consists of the implementation of two programs in C/C++ for the composition of a remote chat service: a server application and another client. The server application will receive connections from clients and replicate every message collected from a client to all connected clients. The client application will connect to a server, and multiple instances of the server can receive and send messages to/from all clients connected to the server. The implementation will use the C/C++ socket library and concurrent programming (PThreads).

## Sockets & Threads

- **Socket programming** is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. The server forms the listener socket while the client reaches out to the server.
- **Pthreads** is an execution model that exists independently from a programming language, as well as a parallel execution model. It allows a program to control multiple different flows of work that overlap in time. Each flow of work is referred to as a thread, and creation and control over these flows is achieved by making calls to the POSIX Threads API.
